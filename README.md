Python Programming was probably my favorite course as it was a great blend of difficulty and creative freedom. The core ccompetencies for the course include: Utilize the development tools and documentation needed to create a Python application, Develop a Python program using data types and variables, Develop a Python program using decision & recursion structures and operators, Develop a Python program using functions and lists, Develop a Python program using file IO, Develop a Python program using classes and objects, Develop a Python program utilizing a SQLite database, and Develop data analytics reports utilizing a Python data library to analyze data. The attached files were the final project of this course which demonstrates a culmination of everything that was learned. I developed the application to help me keep track of Pokemon in a game I have been playing as a hobby.
